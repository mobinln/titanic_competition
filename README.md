# Kaggle Titanic Competition Solution

This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition. The goal of this competition is to predict survival outcomes for passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

In this solution, I implemented several machine learning models and ensemble methods to achieve an accuracy of approximately 80% on the test set. The main algorithms used are:

1. Random Forest
2. XGBoost
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with Bagging
4. AdaBoost

## Results

The ensemble of Random Forest, XGBoost, and KNN models, combined with Bagging and AdaBoost techniques, achieved an accuracy of approximately 80% on the Kaggle test set.

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with more advanced feature engineering techniques
- Try other ensemble methods like stacking
- Perform more extensive hyperparameter tuning
- Investigate deep learning approaches
